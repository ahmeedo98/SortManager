# SortManager

A sort managaer that takes a random array, and sorts it by ascending order, with a chosen algorithm.

Written using Java 11 in IntelliJ.

The sorting algorithms included in the project are:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Selection Sort
6. Binary Tree Sort

Can be used in any IDE of your choice.
Run "App.java" and the user will be prompted to input their choice of sorting algorithm, and array length.

The program will then print your choices, alongside the sorted array.
For performance purposes, the program will also print the time it takes for the chosen algorithm to sort the array.
